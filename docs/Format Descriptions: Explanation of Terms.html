  <td>Basic functionality for a GIS format regardless of underlying content type (raster, vector, or attribute) is georeferencing, placing information in relation to the surface of the earth using place names or assigning coordinates. To align different geospatial resources, they must all use or be transformed to the same geographic reference system, including what is known as a datum.

In addition to the metadata needed to support normal functionality, assessment of a resource's fitness for a particular purpose requires information about the quality of the data and its provenance and lineage. Important characteristics to be recorded in metadata include: projection, scale, datum for coordinates, precision.  For certain categories of GIS files, other characteristics may be significant, e.g. cloud cover percentage for satellite images.

  <td>The geometry of a model describes its shape. There are several approaches to defining the geometry of a 3D model, including point clouds, line sets, meshes (often triangular), constructive solid geometry (built up by combining simple shapes), and free-form surfaces (often using non-uniform rational bi-splines, commonly known as NURBS). The use of NURBS is common in computer graphics for generating and representing curves and surfaces. It offers great flexibility and precision for handling both surfaces defined by common mathematical formulae and modeled shapes.</td>

  <td>Appearance incorporates colors, textures, material types, shading, etc. A common approach for modeling appearance is texture mapping, in which a 2D image is molded to the surface as defined by the geometry. Another approach is to assign appearance attributes (e.g., color, texture, material type) to each face of a surface defined by a mesh. Other aspects of surface appearance include reflectivity (aka specularity) and transparency.</td>

  <td> One of the key features of aggregate files is support for compression and different file formats support a variety of types of compression algorithms, ratios, and methods (i.e., <a href="http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/term.php?term=compressionlossy">lossy</a> and <a href="http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/term.php?term=compressionlossless">lossless</a> compression). RAR, for example, uses proprietary compression algorithms and the compression ratio is stored in the <em>Compression Record</em> tag in the file header; 7z has many options for compression methods whereas ZIP only uses the DEFLATE algorithm. Tar files, on the other hand, are not natively compressed but can be compressed with external utilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="30%" valign="top">Support for error detection</td>
<td>Aggregate files often include parity checks, checksums and other fixity mechanisms for error detection. ZIP files, for example, use a CRC-32 for checking file integrity. RAR also used optional CRC-32 hash values until RAR5 when the method switched to 56 bit length BLAKE2sp hash. In addition, RAR archives have an optional <em>recovery record</em> structure in the archive header. According to <a href="https://documentation.help/WinRAR/HELPArcRecovery.htm">WinRAR Recovery Help</a>, the "presence of recovery record makes an archive [file] larger, but allows to repair it even in case of physical data damage due to disk failure or data loss of any other kind, provided that the damage is not too severe."</td>
